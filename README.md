Description - We plan to develop either a puzzle or a simple, but addicting, adventure type game (similar to Flappy Bird or Doodle Jump). We are hoping to be able to code most of the game using just Python as that is most of our strong language. If we run into any issues using just Python we will look more into other languages that we can use to accomplish our goals.
	We are going to create an auto-updating online scoreboard. The scoreboard will be connected to the game and you will be able to view your scores in real time. It will keep track of your high-scores as well as any other pertinent stats in the game. We hope to add a friends list as well so you can keep track of how you are doing compared to all your friends.

Vision Statement - Create a fun game for our users while cultivating community stewardship through friendly competition. 

Motivation - None of us have really done anything with Game development so we thought this would be a great chance to learn a lot and it would be cool to actually complete an entire game.

Risks - We don’t have very much game development experience between the six of us, so it will be a learning experience for all of us. Our lack of experience could absolutely become a problem in this project.

Risk Mitigation Plan - The only way to really eliminate our risk is going to just be by doing the project and learning as we go. We know we will be able to complete a game using Python so we will always have that as a backup plan, which we can always use to mitigate the risk of not knowing what we are doing.

Version Control - Github

Software Development Methodology - We plan on trying out Agile Scrum to start, and if we don’t like it we will reevaluate our choice and make a new decision. 

Collaboration Tool - We are using GroupME for now, if we find that it is not suitable for our needs then we will switch to Slack most likely.
